Analyse with Admixtools
================

## Prepare ADMIXTOOLS input files to calculate D and outgroup-f3 statistics

convert vcf file to eigenstrat format  
using the vcf file generated from SNP filtering - for stairwayplot, make
sure the outgroups are included

``` bash
module load python
module load R 
module load gdc

cd ./turqueti/tarcap/analyses/admixtools/vcf2eigenstrat

python ./vcf2eigenstrat.py -v ./admixtools.vcf -o tur_5pop_root

#which gives out tur_5pop_root.geno, tur_5pop_root.ind, tur_5pop_root.snp files 

##In the .snp file, my non-standard chromosome names are problematic for running ADMIXTOOLS
##I need to modify the first column (SNP ID) and the second column (CHR ID) of that file as follows:

#First column (SNP ID): replace SNP ID by integers from 1_1 to 1_120857 (=my total number of SNPs). 1_ = chrom 1
#Second column (CHR ID): replace CHR names (or contig names) by integer of 1. Arbitrary name all my contigs as chrom 1 
#third column (genetic distance): set this as 0 
#fourth column(SNP ID): replace SNP ID by integers from 1 to 120857.


##In order to keep track of the SNP positions in the analyses though, which is necessary for the jackknife process of defining blocks, I need to make another file defining the blocks (= which SNP belongs to which CHR). This info will be important to allow calculation of Z_score (statistical significance)

#The file can be called: "my_contigs.txt" and looks like:
#1st column = list of SNP ID as integers from 1_1 to 1_120857
#2nd column = contig names corresponding to where the SNPs are actually located, but these names cannot be like the original complicated "CLocus-81 to CLocus-197238". Instead they need to be integers. In this case, it will be 1 to 5725.
```

## Run ADMIXTOOLS using admixR

Run admixR to calculate D statistics and f3 statistics

``` bash
#Load R
module load conda3
source $CONDA_PROF/conda.sh
conda activate R-3.6.1

#Set .Renviron path to where the folder containing ADMIXTOOL
nano /home/.Renviron
PATH=./AdmixTools/bin

#Then load R
R
```

``` r
library(admixr)
library(tidyverse)

data_prefix <- "./turqueti/tarcap/analyses/admixtools/vcf2eigenstrat/manually_edited/tur_5popseaway_root"
snps <- eigenstrat(data_prefix)
snp_info <- count_snps(snps)

##D statistics 
Dresult <- d(W = c("Amundsen", "Ross"), X = c("EA", "Shetland"), Y = "Weddell", Z = "outgroup",
  data = snps, params = list(blockname = "./admixtools/vcf2eigenstrat/my_contigs.txt"))

write.table(Dresult, file="./results/admixtools/Dresults.txt")

#significant positive D = excess of allele sharing between the first and the third population 
#significant negative D = excess of allele sharing between the second and the third population

##outgroup-f3-statistics 
#Estimate the branch length (shared genetic drift) between a pair of populations A and B with respect to a common outgroup C. 
#In this case, the higher the f3 value, the longer the shared evolutionary time between A and B.

pops <- c("Amundsen", "Ross", "Weddell", "Shetland", "EA")

f3result <- f3(A = pops, B = pops, C = "outgroup", data = snps, params = list(blockname = "./admixtools/vcf2eigenstrat/my_contigs.txt"))

write.table(f3result, file="./results/admixtools/f3results.txt")
```

Then visualise results using ggplot2 in R
